# MonitorUSVisa

Telegram bot created to monitor the US Visa appointments available dates.
As the login page has a captcha verification, the bot requires the user to give a valid cookie to access the page containing the available dates
This bot lets you know as soon as it finds a available date sooner than the one you have scheduled.
You can use /setdate dd/mm/yyyy to find a date that fits you best.


## Things to consider

- After 3 date changes, you're locked for 12 hours.
- This is not official and was developed for studying purposes only

## TODO:

- Set the city
- Better way to capture the cookie
